  caption: The BioMEMS lab at [Whitehead Institute](http://whitehead.mit.edu/) has
    developed a device that makes DNA fingerprinting faster, more accurate, and portable.
    The chip-based device miniaturizes a process called electrophoresis onto a small
    glass chip. In operation, samples of DNA are injected in microchannels etched
    onto the chip's surface, and an electrical current separates the DNA molecules
    based on their size. (Image by [Sam Ogden](http://www.samogden.com/). Used with
